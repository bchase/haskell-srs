### A work in Progress


## Purpose

Right now, I've only gotten started writing the logic to build [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html) [`.apkg`](http://decks.wikia.com/wiki/Anki_APKG_format_documentation) files containing media. (Not functioning, but almost complete.)

Eventually, I'd like to provide means of writing different kinds of decks to `.apkg`, with specific cases that dice up audio and video files.
